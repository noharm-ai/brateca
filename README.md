## Data access

 - agree to terms of confidentiality. The terms are presented in https://forms.gle/raNi1TnJejYLyPZR8;
 - complete a course in protecting human research participants;

Once the process is complete, the researcher's request will be evaluated. The evaluation may take up to two weeks. If the request is accepted, the researcher will be granted access to the data set files.
